# Markovic Dynamic Model

This repository contains the code to simulate the dynamic model of an inverter connected to an electric power system. 

The models are based on the following literature: 
 - [Stability Analysis of Converter Control Modes in Low-Inertia Power Systems](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8571583)
 - [A Virtual Synchronous Machine implementation for distributed control of power converters in SmartGrids](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378779615000024)
 - [Understanding Stability of Low-Inertia Systems](https://engrxiv.org/jwzrq/)
